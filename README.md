## keyInn
KeyInn is a SwiftUI-based mobile app that simplifies hotel check-in and room access by replacing physical key cards with QR-based access and fast digital registration. Users can register using their national ID (TC), book a room and open the door via QR â€” no cards to carry, lose or exchange.
